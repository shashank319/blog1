	<h1>MAGGIE</h1>
<p1> The one of the food item that we would prefer from the childhood is maggi noodles and this is one of the favourite of ours.Maggi is the time saver food and gets prepared within 3 minutes of time I would like to eat maggi cooked as well as the raw one too because the flavour of the maggi is the unique one and there is no company that can beat maggi noodles, Since from the childhood I am the fan of maggi noodles and I would prefer the same to the lunch evening snacks etc as this is the fast food that can be prepared in no time.</p1>
